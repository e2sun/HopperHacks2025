##Inspiration
Seawolf Connect was born from the desire to help students dive deeper into Stony Brook’s vibrant campus life. With over 25,000 students, finding peers with shared interests can be challenging. As an incoming freshman, I was lucky to discover my WISE (Women in Science and Engineering) community—a supportive network where I met some of my closest friends to this day. Now, with Seawolf Connect, I hope to create the same welcoming space for every Seawolf, whether you’re looking to network, build genuine friendships, or form the perfect study group. 

##What it does
Seawolf Connect features an interactive quiz that reveals your unique "wolfienality"—a fun blend of your personality and Seawolf spirit. Once you discover your results, you can opt to add your information to our system, connecting you with fellow Seawolves who share the same mascot match. You'll then be directed to a dedicated page where you can explore and connect with other users who have your wolfienality.

##Built with Passion
We crafted Seawolf Connect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a modern, interactive experience. Our custom illustrations of Wolfie were digitally drawn in Adobe Fresco, and the wolfienality results page were thoughtfully customized using Canva.

##Challenges we ran into
Image Integration: Incorporating our customized digital illustrations of Wolfie into the website posed a unique challenge. We had to make sure the images maintained their quality and responsiveness across all pages.
Database Connectivity: Developing a system to add users with their specific wolfienality and database was an obstacle. This stage required a lot of careful planning and rigorous testing.
Formatting and Styling: Achieving a balanced aesthetic and user-friendly layout posed some challenges in formatting and styling the website, especially the background image.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our effective collaboration with each other as well as our creative aesthetic on our website. We achieved a visually appealing design that balances style and functionality, creating an engaging user experience. Additionally, the digital illustrations of Wolfie, crafted with precision, add a unique and captivating touch to the website. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components linked together harmoniously, resulting in a smooth and interactive platform.
What we learned
We deepened our understanding of JavaScript’s dynamic features, which helped us create interactive elements on our site. Additionally, experimenting with various CSS styling components enabled us to design a balanced and responsive layout. Our skills in Adobe Fresco and Canva improved significantly, allowing us to produce high-quality digital illustrations and customized design elements. Building a website from the ground up taught us the intricacies of web design and development, and we gained a newfound respect for the craft behind every well-designed website.

##What's next for SeawolfConnect
Going forward we want to implement React in order to streamline the HTML implementation and make it so that the content remains within the database even after the page reloads. Additionally, we would like to add functionality for a more sophisticated user base that allows people to sign in and chat with their connections directly through the website.
